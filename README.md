# Welcome

Bellow you'll find the instructions you must complete to successfully pass the test.

May the force be with you.

# How to

-   Fork the repository and make your changes in your own private fork
-   Invite q.luc@soilcapital.com to the fork

## What needs to be done

-   Be a hacker: find a way to successfully login to the app - hint: no code change needed.

Password: hU3HUAy^yf97 -> found in services/auth.api.ts
E-mail: Any of the mail listed in the API endpoint /users

-   Be a saviour: fix a bug in the app. Each time we refresh the page, we're back to the login screen. Fix it so we stay on the current page.

-   Be a builder: add new a page to the app and fetch all photos (/photos) with the same API as the one used for the login.
